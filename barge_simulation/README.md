# Barge Space-Time Network Simulation

This project implements a simulation of barges operating in a space-time network, developed as part of the "Modélisation et Simulation des Systèmes Complexes" course (M1 TNSID 2024/2025).

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code directory
  - `model/`: Contains the core simulation models
  - `data/`: Data handling and processing
  - `simulation/`: Simulation engine and logic
  - `visualization/`: Visualization tools
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `data/`: Input and output data
- `docs/`: Documentation

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Simulation
Instructions for running the simulation will be added as the project develops.

## Project Requirements
The project implements the following key components:
- Space-time network modeling
- Barge movement simulation
- Resource management
- Data collection and analysis
- Model validation
