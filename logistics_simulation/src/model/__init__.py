"""
Barge Transportation Logistics Simulation Model

This package implements a discrete event simulation for barge transportation logistics,
focusing on space-time network representation and demand-service assignment.

Key components:
- Network: Manages the space-time network and route finding
- Service: Represents transportation services with legs and schedules
- Demand: Handles transportation demands and their status
- Simulation: Implements the discrete event simulation engine
